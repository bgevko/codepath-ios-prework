Submitted by: **Bogdan Gevko**

**iOS Basics** is an elementary iOS application for the CodePath iOS course. It's a beginner exercise to get familiar with using Xcode and Swift. Its primary function is to change the background color when the user taps a button on the screen.

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## App Brainstorming
---
What makes a great mobile app? Although I don't yet have the developer experience to give a qualified answer, I can still draw insights from my experience, as I've been using a smartphone since 2007. In my 16 years of using mobile apps, the apps that I liked the most were the ones that let me forget that I was using a mobile device. The user interface of a great app just works. It enables the user to focus on the experience without drawing too much attention to itself. Here are three apps that I believe have an outstanding user experience: 

### Gmail
Gmail provides a lot of functionality without cluttering screenspace. The bottom navigation bar has two tabs, one for emails and one for meetings. Additionally, there's a floating compose button at the bottom right of the screen, which is always visible no matter where you are in the UI. Both bottom UI elements dynamically shrink as the user scrolls down, anticipating the user's intention and giving way to more screen space. Tapping the hamburger icon in the top left slides in the navigation menu for switching inboxes, which scrolls if you have a lot of mailboxes. Picking a mailbox or swiping it off-screen makes the menu disappear. Overall, Gmail provides an excellent case study of mobile user navigation with support for a dynamic number of pages.

### Pinterest
Pinterest seamlessly fits images with varying heights side by side in a two-column masonry pattern. Images stack on each other like bricks, and it works great. This design decision allows Pinterest to show more images onscreen, leaning into its intended use of providing visual inspiration, whereas a traditional single-column design may have been less effective in this case.

### YouTube
YouTube's user interface is not perfect, but one feature I like is that you can swipe down your current video and scroll through other content while the current video continues playing at the bottom of the screen. This is a very user-centered feature, as it allows users to browse for the next video while the current one is about to finish, similar to how we browse for music.

### Ideas for my app
Although these features seem unrelated, they share a common thread: user-centric features. I am not interested in building clones of any of these apps, but I am very interested in thinking from the end. I want to develop an app that I will use in real life. One idea I want to build is a metronome app for practicing music. I came up with a few user stories that would serve as the base functionality for the app:
- As a user, I'd like to be able to set settings to increment my tempo by X amount of beats every X amount of bars or every X amount of seconds/minutes so that I can configure my metronome settings for practicing songs without having to adjust settings manually.
- As a user, I'd like to save tempo presets for songs to easily switch settings based on the music I'm currently practicing.
- As a user, I'd like to set tempo by tapping the screen to easily copy the tempos of other music I am trying to learn by ear. 
I have quite a few more features in my mind, but these stories will provide a solid base for the first stable version of my app, should I decide to pursue this idea. 

## Notes
I wasn't sure how to properly switch the directory of my project (still wondering). While tinkering, I ended up deleting and recreating my build settings. Because I couldn't figure out how to sync a new build to an existing folder, I restarted the project in my git directory. I didn't mind starting over, as the repetition helped me solidify the concepts. The second iteration of the project also turned out more visually appealing.
